# Quick-Commerce Analysis – SLA, Refunds, Customer Ratings & Delivery Performance

This project analyzes operational performance for quick-commerce platforms (Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, JioMart) using Python + ML + Power BI.
We cleaned and explored order-level data, engineered features (SLA breach, refund %, delays), built a simple ML model to understand refund risk, and created a Power BI dashboard to surface patterns affecting delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

## Problem
Quick-commerce companies struggle with:

High SLA breach rates during peak hours

Unexpected refund spikes from certain customer segments

Inconsistent delivery performance across days & time slots

Low customer ratings despite acceptable delivery times

This analysis identifies where and why these issues occur so operations teams can make data-driven improvements.

Swiggy Instamart has the highest SLA breach %, while JioMart suffers from the worst customer ratings.

Refund risk is strongly driven by customer segment, with “At-Risk” users refunding at 30%+.

Delivery delays peak on Monday mornings and Saturday afternoons, correlating with higher refund % and low ratings.

SLA failures between 8–11 AM significantly influence both refunds and customer dissatisfaction.

##Conclusion

This project provides a clear operational diagnostic:
Which platforms deliver poorly, when delays happen, which customer groups refund most, and how SLA issues translate into customer dissatisfaction.
These insights can directly guide operational fixes, staffing adjustments, and service-quality improvements.
